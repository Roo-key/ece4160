# ECE 4160 Fast Robots
## Cornell University, Spring 2023

Hey, I'm Larry and I'm a junior double majoring in ECE and CS enrolled in ECE 4160: Fast Robots for the Spring 2023 semester. I'm taking this class to learn more about the applications of electrical engineering and to gain more hands on robotics experience. This website is a compilation of lab documentation that I've worked on throughout the semester. I need a job.
