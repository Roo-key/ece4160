# ECE 4160 Fast Robots
## Cornell University, Spring 2023

Hey, I'm Larry and I'm a junior enrolled in ECE 4160: Fast Robots for the Spring 2023 semester. I'm a double major in ECE and CS and am taking this class to gain some more hands on robotics experience. This website is a compilation of lab documentation that I've worked on throughout the semester. Please help me get a job.
